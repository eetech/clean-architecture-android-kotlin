# Android Clean Architecture - Kotlin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/patrickyin/clean-architecture-android-kotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/patrickyin/clean-architecture-android-kotlin) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-clean--architecture--android--kotlin-green.svg?style=flat )]( https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6851)

***This is an Android Clean Architecture base project using 100% Kotlin including Unit tests!***

You could use it as the base project when you create a new Android project. This architecture optimized the Clean Architecture and MVP for the Android Kotlin project. When using this architecture, you could isolate the UI, business logic and data sources, and also making the unit test easier. It uses latest and most popular technologies e.g. Dagger2, RxJava etc.

## Benefit

* Makes your new project clean
* Isolates UI, business logic and data sources' responsibilities
* Testable
* Avoids multi-threading problems

## Approach of Clean Architecture for Android
There are 3 layers in the project: Data, Domain and Presentation(UI), and the UI layer contains view and presenters.

## Multi-threading
Base `UseCase` class handles the thread of Rx chains, it puts  whole chain on IO thread, and then changes back to Android main thread(UI thread) for the steps after use case execution. That means when you write the project based on this project, then you don't have to worry about any multi-threading issue.
